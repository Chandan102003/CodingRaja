# MusicPlayer
I'll be creating a web-based music player with a sleek user interface, allowing users to play music directly in their browser.
I'll also be implementing features like track seeking and volume control using the methods provided by the HTMLMediaElement interface, without the need for external libraries.
I'll start by designing the HTML layout to define the player's structure. 
Then, I'll apply CSS styling to make it visually appealing. 
Lastly, I'll write the JavaScript logic to enable all the player's functions and ensure smooth control over audio playback.
